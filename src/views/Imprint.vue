              The Senckenberg Society for Nature Research – Leibniz Institution
              for Biodiversity and Earth System Research (SGN) is an
              unincorporated association according to § 22 of the BGB (German
              Civil Code) that was awarded the rights of a legal person by
              sovereign decree on 17 August 1867. According to § 28 of the
              currently applicable statute, the association as defined by § 26
              of the BGB is represented judicially and extrajudicially by two
              members of the Board of Directors, which must include the Director
              General or the Deputy Director General.

            <p><strong>Data Protection</strong></p>
            <p>
              The protection of personal data is very important to the SGN.
              Therefore, the SGN collects and processes your data on this
              website exclusively in accordance with the European provisions of
              the Basic Data Protection Regulations (DSGVO) in accordance with
              the new Federal Data Protection (BDSG-neu) and the Telemedia Act
              (TMG) for the SGN’s association-related purposes. The SGN
              therefore only collects, uses, and passes on personal data if this
              is permitted by law, or if you give consent for the data
              collection.
            </p>

              <strong
                >Legal Basis for the Processing of Data according to the
                DSGVO</strong
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              The obtaining of consent is regulated by Article 6, Paragraph 1 a
              and Article 7 of the DSGVO; the legal basis for the processing in
              order to conduct contractual measures and for the reply to
              inquiries is 6, Paragraph 1 b of the DSGVO. The processing for the
              fulfilment of legal obligations occurs in accordance with Article
              6, Paragraph 1 c of the DSGVO. The legal basis for the processing
              to safeguard Senckenberg‘s legitimate interests is Article 6,
              Paragraph 1 f of the DSGVO. In the event that the essential
              interests of the affected person or another natural person require
              the processing of personal data, Article 6, Paragraph 1 d of the
              DSGVO applies.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Senckenberg, this primarily involves the collection, storage,
              and processing of your contact and user data
            </p>

            <p><strong>Transmission into Third Countries</strong></p>
            <p>
              Data will only be processed in a third country (i.e., outside the
              European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) if this
              is required for the fulfilment of contractual obligation, based on
              your consent, due to a legal obligation, or on the basis of our
              legitimate interests. The data will only be processed in a third
              country in the presence of the special conditions outlined in
              Article 44 et seq. of the DSGVO (officially recognized
              determination of a data protection level in keeping with EU
              regulations, e.g., by the “Privacy Shield” in the USA or
              officially recognized, special contractual obligations, so-called
              “standard contract clauses”).

            <p>
              You can informally object to the use of your data at any
              time.&nbsp;Under certain conditions according to Article 15 et
              seq. of the DSGVO, you further have the right to information,
              correction, blocking, and deletion of the data stored by us.<br />

            <p><strong>Personal Data</strong></p>
            <p>
              Personal data involve all information regarding your personal or
              factual circumstances that can be used to identify a person. This
              includes information such as your name, mailing address, telephone
              number, and e-mail address. Information that cannot be directly
              associated with your true identity (e.g., length of visit to a
              website or number of website users that cannot be associated with
              your IP address) do not fall in this category.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, transmitted personal data will not be passed on to third
              parties, unless this is urgently required by law. They are deleted
              upon conclusion of the business process and expiry of the legal
              retention requirements, in accordance with the statutory
              provisions.

            </p>
            <p>
              For this, we need your consent that the SGN will only collect,
              process, and use your name and e-mail address for the mailing of
              the newsletter, the communication of internal offers, and

              browser type, the user’s operating system, referrer URL, and IP

            </p>
            <p>
              It is possible that third-party online content such as YouTube
              videos, maps by Google Maps, RSS feeds, or graphics from other
              websites will be incorporated in our online content. This always
              requires that the content provider (hereafter referred to as
              third-party provider) records the user’s IP address, since the
              content cannot be transmitted to the respective user’s browser
              without the IP address. The IP address is therefore necessary for
              the display of the content. We make an effort to only offer
              content by providers that will use the IP address exclusively for
              the provision of this content. However, we have no influence over
              the possibility that a third-party provider may store the IP
              address for statistical purposes, etc.&nbsp; To the extent that
              this is known to us, we will inform the user in this regard.
